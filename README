This is a set of Windows Batch files to convert EAD to PDF using Saxon and FOP.

Requirements:

- FOP 0.95 or higher (1.0 recommended)
- SAXON 9 or higher
- The font Arial Unicode MS
- Stylesheets from http://www.library.yale.edu/facc/xsl/fo/

Installation:

- Download all stylesheets from http://www.library.yale.edu/facc/xsl/fo/ and
  place them into the "xslt" subdirectory.

- Edit fop-saxon.bat to point to the proper location of the JAR file for FOP
  and the JAR file for Saxon

- Edit batch-fop.bat to point to the right directories for the conversion. The batch
  file expects the following hierarchy of directories currently:
    D:\
     |__ EAD2PDF
          |__ in
          |__ logs
          |__ out
          |__ scripts
               |__ xslt

- Create any additional directoriesd as needed.

Running the Transformation

- Place EAD files into the "in" directory.

- Run batch-fop.bat.

- If successful, the EAD file will be moved to the "out" directory and the PDF will 
  be placed in the "out" directory.

- If unsuccessful, the EAD file will be left to the "in" directory.

- Logs will be placed in the "logs" directory and contain information about
  whether the process was successful.
